**Android Remote Debugger** is a library for remote debugging Android applications. It allows you to view logs, databases, shared preferences and network requests directly in the browser.

## Features
* Logging
	* View the logs of your application
	* Filter logs by priority and tags
	* Search logs
	* Download logs
	* Crash errors are also logged
* Database
	* View all databases
	* Edit database entries
 	* Delete database entries
 	* Search data
 	* Run custom sql query to get, add, update or delete data
* SharedPreferences
	* View all data
	* Edit, add and delete data
	* Search data
* Network
	* View all network requests and responses in a convenient format
	* Filter data by response code and errors
	* Download logs
	* Search data

## Integration
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Add the following dependency to your module's build.gradle:
```groovy
dependencies {
    debugImplementation 'com.github.chenyue404:android-remote-debugger:$version'
    releaseImplementation 'com.github.zerobranch.android-remote-debugger:noop:1.1.2'
}
```
**Note:** The final line above will use a no-op version, which does nothing.
It should only be used in production build.
This makes it impossible to run the server on a production build.
 
## How to use ?
Android Remote Debugger has 4 sections:

* Logging
* Database
* Shared Preferences
* Network

For the `Logging`, `Database` and `Shared Preferences` sections to work, several steps are necessary:

1. Call: **`AndroidRemoteDebugger.init(applicationContext)`** in the application code.

2. After launching your application, you will receive a notification in the notification panel, in which a link of the type: http://xxx.xxx.x.xxx:8080 will be indicated. Just follow this link in your browser. Also, an entry will be added to logcat: `D/AndroidRemoteDebugger: Android Remote Debugger is started. Go to: http://xxx.xxx.x.xxx:8080`

3. To view the logs in the `Logging` section, you must call the static methods `AndroidRemoteDebugger.Log` anywhere in your application, for example, `AndroidRemoteDebugger.Log.d("tag", "message")` or `AndroidRemoteDebugger.Log.log(priority, tag, msg, throwable)` with all parameters specified.

4. To view network logs in the `Network` section, it is necessary to use the [OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/okhttp) library and add the `NetLoggingInterceptor` interceptor. Recommended to add it after all others interceptors to get actual network traffic data.

```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(new NetLoggingInterceptor())
    .build();
```

**Attention**

* Your Android device and computer must be connected to the same network (Wi-Fi or LAN).
* You can also use debugging via usb or Android Default Emulator. To do this, run the command: `adb forward tcp:8080 tcp:8080` and go to the address:
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) or [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080) in your browser.
* If you use Android Default Emulator, then you may also need to turn on the mobile Internet and turn off WI-FI.

### Additional settings
To configure the library, use `AndroidRemoteDebugger.Builder`

```java
AndroidRemoteDebugger.init(
    new AndroidRemoteDebugger.Builder(applicationContext)
        .enabled(boolean)
        .disableInternalLogging()
        .enableDuplicateLogging()
        .disableJsonPrettyPrint()
        .disableNotifications()
        .excludeUncaughtException()
        .port(int)
        .build()
);
```

### Description of `AndroidRemoteDebugger.Builder` parameters
All parameters for `AndroidRemoteDebugger.Builder` are optional. For standard library operation, just call `AndroidRemoteDebugger.init(applicationContext)`.

```java
.enabled(boolean) - library enable control
.disableInternalLogging() - disable internal logs of Android Remote Debugger
.disableJsonPrettyPrint() - disable pretty print json in `Logging` and` Network` sections
.disableNotifications() - disable Android Remote Debugger status notifications
.excludeUncaughtException() - exclude log printing when application crashes
.port(int) - use a different port than 8080
.enableDuplicateLogging() - all logs from `Logging` section will also be printed in logcat
.enableDuplicateLogging(new Logger() { - callback to get all logs from `Logging` section
    @Override
    public void log(int priority, String tag, String msg, Throwable th) {
    }
})
```

The `NetLoggingInterceptor` interceptor has two constructors: empty and with a callback to get all logs from `Network` section

```java
new NetLoggingInterceptor(new NetLoggingInterceptor.HttpLogger() {
    @Override
    public void log(HttpLogModel httpLogModel) {
    }
})
```

### Description of Logging page parameters
<img src="/screenshots/logging_2.png" alt="logging_2.png" title="logging_2.png" width="489" height="260" /> 

1. Choosing a logging level
2. Filter the logs by tag
3. Enable/disable autoscroll when receiving new logs
4. Go to the top of the list
5. Go to the end of the list
6. Enable/disable colors for logs
7. Delete all logs

### Note
* A link to the debugger page can also be obtained as follows: http://ip-address-of-your-android-device:port (you can see the ip-address-of-your-android-device in the settings of your device).
* If you use debugging via usb or Android Default Emulator and you want to use a different port, for example, 8081, then you need to run the following command: `adb forward tcp:8081 tcp:8081`.
* To use this library on one Android device for two applications simultaneously, you need to use different ports.

## R8 / ProGuard
If you use R8, you don't have to do anything. The specific rules are included automatically.

If you don't use R8 you have to apply the following rules:
```
-keep class zerobranch.androidremotedebugger.source.models.** { *; }
-keep class zerobranch.androidremotedebugger.source.local.LogLevel
```

You might also need rules from [OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/okhttp) and [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson), which are dependencies of this library.
